## Continuous Listening Mode

### Description
Implement an always-on listening mode that activates upon detecting a trigger word or phrase.

### Technical Approach
1. **WebAudio API Integration**
   - Use AudioContext to continuously process audio in the background
   - Implement a lightweight trigger word detection algorithm

2. **Trigger Word Detection**
   - Create a small model for detecting custom trigger phrases (e.g., "Hey Search")
   - Use WebWorkers to run detection in a separate thread to avoid UI blocking

3. **Power Management**
   - Implement sleep/wake cycles to conserve battery
   - Add visual indicators for listening state

4. **Privacy Controls**
   - Add clear user permissions and controls
   - Implement local processing where possible
   - Add visual and audio cues when listening is active

### Implementation Steps
1. Create a new `useContinuousListening` hook
2. Implement trigger word detection using WebAudio API
3. Add user interface for trigger word configuration
4. Implement power-saving measures
5. Add comprehensive privacy controls and notifications

## Multiple Search Engine Integration

### Description
Allow users to search across multiple search engines simultaneously or select their preferred search provider.

### Technical Approach
1. **Search Provider Abstraction**
   - Create a provider interface for different search engines
   - Implement adapters for Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc.

2. **Results Aggregation**
   - Develop a system to merge and rank results from multiple providers
   - Implement tabbed interface for viewing results by provider

3. **Provider Selection**
   - Allow users to set default providers
   - Enable context-based automatic provider selection

4. **API Integration**
   - Implement proper API authentication for each provider
   - Handle rate limiting and fallbacks

### Implementation Steps
1. Create a `SearchProviderFactory` class
2. Implement provider-specific adapters
3. Develop results aggregation algorithm
4. Create UI for provider selection and results display
5. Add provider-specific settings and preferences

## Knowledge Graph Integration

### Description
Integrate with knowledge bases to provide direct answers to queries without requiring a full search.

### Technical Approach
1. **Knowledge Source Integration**
   - Connect to Wikipedia, Wikidata, and other open knowledge bases
   - Implement a local cache for common queries

2. **Answer Generation**
   - Extract relevant information from knowledge sources
   - Format answers in a user-friendly way

3. **Visual Presentation**
   - Create card-based UI for knowledge graph results
   - Include images, links, and related information

4. **Fallback Mechanism**
   - Gracefully fall back to traditional search when direct answers aren't available

### Implementation Steps
1. Create a `KnowledgeGraphService` class
2. Implement API connections to knowledge sources
3. Develop answer extraction and formatting logic
4. Design and implement the knowledge card UI
5. Add caching and performance optimizations

## Advanced AI Features

### Natural Language Processing

#### Intent Recognition
- Implement a classifier to categorize queries into:
  - Questions (who, what, when, where, why, how)
  - Navigation requests (go to, open, show me)
  - Commands (search for, find, play)
  - Conversational (chat-like queries)

#### Entity Extraction
- Extract key entities from queries:
  - Named entities (people, places, organizations)
  - Dates and times
  - Quantities and measurements
  - Products and services

#### Sentiment Analysis
- Analyze user frustration levels based on:
  - Voice tone and speed
  - Repeated queries
  - Cancellation patterns
- Adapt the interface based on detected sentiment:
  - Offer more help for frustrated users
  - Simplify UI when stress is detected
  - Provide more detailed results for curious users

### Technical Approach
1. **Model Selection**
   - Use TensorFlow.js for client-side NLP
   - Consider hybrid approach with server-side processing for complex queries

2. **Training and Fine-tuning**
   - Use transfer learning from pre-trained models
   - Fine-tune with domain-specific data

3. **Integration Architecture**
   - Create a pipeline for processing voice input through multiple NLP stages
   - Implement feedback loops to improve accuracy over time

### Implementation Steps
1. Create an `NLPProcessor` class with modular components
2. Implement intent classification using a lightweight model
3. Add entity extraction capabilities
4. Develop sentiment analysis module
5. Create adaptive UI components that respond to NLP insights
