## 🔄 Enhancement Plan

We're actively working on several exciting enhancements to the Voice Search application. For detailed information about our implementation plans, technical approaches, and timelines, please refer to our [Enhancement Plan](PLAN.md) document.

### Key Enhancements in Progress

#### Continuous Listening Mode
Implementing an always-on listening mode that activates upon detecting a trigger word or phrase, allowing for a truly hands-free experience.

#### Multiple Search Engine Integration
Enabling searches across Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and other providers simultaneously, with results aggregation and comparison.

#### Knowledge Graph Integration
Connecting to knowledge bases to provide direct answers to queries without requiring a full search, similar to featured snippets.

#### Advanced AI Features
- **Intent Recognition**: Understanding the type of search (question, navigation, command)
- **Entity Extraction**: Identifying key entities in voice queries for better search results
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detecting user frustration and adapting the interface accordingly
